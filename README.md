# About me
- 👋 Hello, my name is @Simo-N-Maduna. I was born and educated in South Africa, but I currently reside and make my living in Norway.
- 👀 Applied genomic research in the fields of molecular ecology and aquaculture intrigues me. I'm always eager to contribute to the analysis of genetic data, as well as phenotypic and environmental data. 
- 🌱 I am currently studying computational approaches for de novo reference genome assemblies of (complex) eukaryotes, phylogenomics, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and seascape/landscape genomics.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on developing bioinformatic workflows for processing of the different types of datasets. 
- 📫 You can reach me at maduna.researcher@gmail.com
