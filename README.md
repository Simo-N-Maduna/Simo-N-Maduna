# About me
- 👋 Hi, I’m @Simo-N-Maduna, a South African by birth and education, and a Norwegian by livelihood.
- 👀 I’m interested in applied genomic research in fields of molecular ecology and aquaculture. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computational approaches for *de novo* reference genome assemblies of (complex) eukaryotes, GWAS and seascape/landscape genomics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a bioinformatics pipeline for de novo reference genome assembly.
