# About me
- 👋 Hi, I’m @Simo-N-Maduna, a South African by birth and education, and a Norwegian by residence and livelihood.
- 👀 I’m interested in applied genomic research in the fields of molecular ecology and aquaculture. I am always eager to parcipate in genetic data analysis. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computational approaches for *de novo* reference genome assemblies of (complex) eukaryotes, GWAS and seascape/landscape genomics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on bioinformatic workflows for population datasets.
